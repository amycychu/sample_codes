Two simple tools demonstrate my Python script skills.

## Re-number images tool:
It has both command line and gui. The purpose of this tool is to re-number the sequences of images (same extension) of a given folder path. 
```
test2340.exr, test11.exr, test500.exr --> test[01-03].exr
test11.jpg, test22.jpg, test33.jpg, test44.jpg --> test[01-04].jpg
```

## Share Copy and Paste in Houdini:
Houdini shelf tools Share Copy and Share Paste, which allow users to copy the nodes and network items to a shared path for others to pick up and 'paste' in the scene. 
(Nodes can be shared cross-sites too if the transfer/sync command is added.)
